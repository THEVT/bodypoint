	<h1>We&#39re a little different</h1>


	<p>We like to think about things from a different angle. Flip an idea inside out. Look at it upside down. Tilt it sideways. Find new and better ways to solve old problems. We are a diverse team with a wide range of expertise. But we&#39re bonded together by our shared love of a challenge, optimism about the future and passion for creating solutions that improve the lives of wheelchair users.</p>

	<p>We know our service is an expression of the respect and consideration we have for our customers. We truly care about the people using our products, so we go to extraordinary lengths to address their individual needs.</p>

            Bodypoint is a mark of quality: we always strive for perfection. If it doesn&#39t adjust easily, grip securely, or fit just right, it doesn&#39t earn our name.</p>

            <p><em><a href="#">Knowledge</a></em><br>
    
            We know how things work, and why they need to. We blend our understanding of postural support with expertise in materials and design to build better connections between people and wheelchairs.</p>

            Good posture and mobility is essential for all of us. We advocate for those in the wheelchair community by promoting education, and providing tools and techniques that can transform people&#39s lives.</p>
