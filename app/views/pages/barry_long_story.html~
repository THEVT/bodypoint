			<p>Barry’s unbridled enthusiasm for life and adventure is contagious. An intrepid explorer, his extreme sports exploits give him a unique way to test the limits of his equipment. Consequently, we asked Barry, who is also one to not mince words, to product test the <a href="link to Evoflex product page">Evoflex Pelvic Stabilizer</a> and provide us feedback.</p>

			<p>For Barry, the only times he had worn a pelvic positioning device, or ‘belt’, was during sports. In the case of an athletic sports event - downhill mountain biking, waterskiing, or bungee jump, he thought nothing of locking himself down to be more connected to the wheelchair or sports equipment. But in everyday life, he never even considered it. </p>

			<p>After he used the Evoflex, he provided us a full report. Here’s his summation: </p>

			<p><i>“I have been [so] pleasantly surprised that I not only use the Evoflex Pelvic Stabilizer on my chair constantly, but will continue to use it. They [Bodypoint] have definitely made my mobility ‘push’ more efficient and I like the firmness the belt gives me when in motion!”</i></p>
