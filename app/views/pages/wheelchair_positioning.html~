		<h1>Wheelchair <br>Positioning</h1>

		<p>The human body is an elegant design. When properly aligned from the core outward, it’s a beautiful symphony of physiology. For people using wheelchairs, good positioning is fundamental to their everyday comfort, well being and independence.</p>

		<h2>Its Personal To Us</h2>

		<p>Wheelchair positioning begins with the person, not the equipment. By keeping the individual at the center of the conversation, we are creating solutions adapted to their needs.</p>

		<p>Good seating begins with the basics – the seat, the backrest, and the user’s orientation in the wheelchair – but to be effective, it doesn’t end there. Bodypoint builds on this foundation with a wide range of additional postural supports that increase the user’s 
	comfort and mobility, ultimately creating a better connection between the person and the wheelchair. Whether it’s the joystick handle that fits the curves of the palm, the belt that doesn’t slip, or the footplates that can be fine­tuned to reduce joint stress, we tackle each positioning challenge from the user’s point of view.</p>

		<p>We are positioning champions. By concentrating on solutions that are comfortable, easy­to­use and highly adaptable, we strive to advance postural support design and enable people using wheelchairs to reach their full potential.</p>
