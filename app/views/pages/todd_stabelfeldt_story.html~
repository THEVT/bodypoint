		<h3>Todd Stabelfeldt really gets around with his Tri-lock™ Rotating Shaft</h3>

		<p>Visiting on site at Bodypoint in Seattle, WA, Todd Stabelfeldt shared how long his <a href="#">Tri-lock™ Rotating Shaft</a> has been serving him well, allowing for thousands of miles of confident travel.</p>

		<p><i>“As a man with C4 quadriplegia, my world is in millimeters. My Bodypoint Midline Joystick, gives me independence allowing me to drive with my chin - this is critical to my success! I've had the Midline now for more than a decade and it has not failed. Period.”</i></p>

			<p>Todd Stabelfeldt shared his story of the need for reliable equipment to support his independence while on site at the Bodypoint. According to Todd, it all started over 10 years ago with a Bodypoint staff member that he first met on the ferryboat where he was commuting from Bainbridge Island to Seattle.</p>

			<p>During the conversation that day, he told Bodypoint about his work travel requirements and shared some concerns that he had with regards to his seating system and how it did not keep the controls consistently close to his chin to be reliable. Todd is a C4 quadriplegic and has no movement below his shoulders, so control of his devices is completely managed with this chin and mouth.</p>

			<p>During this discussion, he learned that his office was just blocks away from the Bodypoint headquarters. Todd accepted an invitation for a visit and ended up being fitted with a Tri-lock Rotating Shaft — not realizing that it was actually a prototype. This installation immediately allowed Todd to more effectively control his power chair and gave him more confidence in his controls.</p>

			<p>Years later – and tens of thousands of miles down the road – he checked in with Bodypoint to explain how it now “had too much wiggle.” It turns out that the same prototype unit had lasted many years and served him well to get around but needed a little tweaking.</p>

			<p>So, Bodypoint invited him to come by their offices to visit again and have his Tri-lock Rotating Shaft inspected. Looking it over, the Bodypoint engineer realized that Todd had been using that early prototype version and informed him how design improvements had been made to it since his model was built. Bodypoint replaced his Tri-lock which immediately tightened up Todd’s controls.</p>

			<p>Afterward, the Bodypoint team had Todd zip back and forth around the Bodypoint offices as he test drove his new <a href="link to video here" target="_blank">Tri-lock Rotating Shaft</a>.</p>

			<p>Getting Todd’s thoughts after his test drive, he shared his startling realization with us.  “I didn’t’ know that it was a prototype! I haven’t had to even think about my controls being where I need them for ten years, that’s pretty amazing!” Todd said.</p>
