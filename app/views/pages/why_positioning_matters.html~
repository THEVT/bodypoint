		<h1>Positioned <br>For Success</h1>

		<p>Skiers require properly­fitted boots and bindings. Parents place their newborn in a rear­facing car seat. Cyclists make sure their helmets are strapped on correctly. Proper positioning of our bodies – in coordination with the devices we use – is important to all 
of us for safety, function, comfort and a sense of well being.</p>

		<h2>Its Personal To Us</h2>

		<p>At Bodypoint, we don’t just make high quality postural support products for wheelchair users. We also strive to educate our community about the vital importance of physical positioning in a wheelchair. Sometimes, the right positioning means a person is
 able to compete as an Olympic athlete. Sometimes it means relief from pressure sores. Sometimes it enables an upright posture that raises someone’s self-esteem. Whatever the reason, positioning has a huge influence on the quality of life for people in wheelchairs.</p>

		<p>So while we work tirelessly to create extraordinary positioning products, our true mission is always top of mind. We are helping people achieve their full potential. We are champions of positioning.</p>

		<h2>See it their way</h2>

		<p>Wheelchair support and positioning is fundamentally important in terms of the user’s safety and comfort. But if you ask the wheelchair community, you’ll find many other reasons that proper positioning is essential to them – things Bodypoint cares about too. Whether you’re a user, therapist caregiver or supplier, we all recognize that positioning can have a big impact on the lives and livelihoods of people using wheelchairs.</p>
