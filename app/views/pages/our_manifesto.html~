		<p>The human experience is different for each of us.  We all have personal goals, and must overcome our own obstacles to reach them.  What's more, we each measure our success in different ways.  There's just no one-size-fits-all solution for achieving individual potential.  At Bodypoint, we understand and embrace this challenge.</p>
		<p>We are committed to designing and manufacturing the best postural support products for every sort of wheelchair user.  To deliver on that promise, each product we make must be easily adapted to individual needs â€“ and empower every person to achieve their personal best.</p>
		<p>Many wheelchairs come with standard positioning accessories built to meet the basic requirements of a very broad market.  But we've found that most wheelchair users benefit from a more individualized approach that addresses their specific needs and challenges.  This respect for individuality is at the core of our design approach.  We rely on a keen sense of observation, creative thinking and technical ability to translate our customers' needs into products they love.  Today, Bodypoint is recognized around the world for creating positioning products that server both specialized populations and individual requirements within complex rehab.</p>
		<p>We know that every device we make, no matter how simple, will affect someone's experience every day.  That's why we use high-quality materials and conduct rigorous testing to ensure that our products deliver the utmost in comfort, safety, durability, appearance and performance.  Our customers rely on our products to help them get more out of life.  Dependable quality matters to them, so it matters to us.</p>
		<p>Creating exceptional products that enable wheelchair users to strengthen their position is what drives us.  We are positioning champions.</p>
