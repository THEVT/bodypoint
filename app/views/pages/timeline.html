		<p class="t1994"><span style="font-size: 25px;">1994</span> We introduce the first medial 4-point hip belt, which greatly reduces shifting of the pelvis to improve stability in the wheelchair.</p>
		<p class="t1996"><span style="font-size: 25px;">1996</span> Our Ankle HuggersÂ® Support Straps revolutionize leg support and foot positioning to provide a more friendly, comfortable and dynamic alternative to rigid shoe holders or foot straps.</p>
		<p class="t2001_tri"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2001</span> Our Tri-lock Midline Joystick Mount offers huge improvements over previous models, quickly becoming a preferred after-market chair accessory for its versatility and precision-action.</p>
		<p class="t2005"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2005</span> Combining the strength of a shoulder harness with the comfort of a stretchy butterfly bib, the Dynamic Stayflexâ„¢ Chest Support ensures optimal trunk control while reducing the choking hazard found in many chest supports.</p>
		<p class="t2008"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2008</span> The patented Rehab Latchâ„¢ buckle is the first buckle designed specifically around the needs of wheelchair users â€“ easily manipulated by the weakest hands, yet secure enough to resist accidental release.</p>
		<p class="t2011"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2011</span> Solving the age-old problem of having a belt get caught in the wheelchair during transfer, we create the EvoflexÂ® Pelvic Stabilizer with its patented tapered thermoplastic end strap.</p>

		<p class="t1995"><span style="font-size: 25px;">1995</span> We patent the ClickitÂ® Seat Latch</p>
		<p class="t2001_ful"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2001</span> The Fulcrum Adjustable Angle Footplate is introduced and wins Best New Product at the Canadian Posture and Seating Symposium for its revolutionary way of accommodating foot inversion/eversion.</p>
		<p class="t2003"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2003</span> We introduce and patent the Cinch-Mountâ„¢ End Fitting, which enables quick installation and makes it extremely easy to adjust the length and buckle placement of any belt or harness.</p>
		<p class="t2004"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2004</span> The patented Hip GripÂ® Pelvic Stabilizer dramatically changes the concept of pelvic stability from a fixed position to a stabilized range of movement that enhances reach and independence.</p>
		<p class="t2007"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2007</span> We think outside the wheelchair to introduce the AeromeshÂ® Bath Belt, addressing the challenge of securing users in wet and slippery shower chairs with a quick-drying material that is friendly to the skin.</p>
		<p class="t2010"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2010</span> The patented modular Push-Button buckle allows for ease-of-release fine tuning and makes it the most adaptable, compact, easy-to-tighten and indestructible means of securing a wheelchair belt.</p>
		<p class="t2013"><span style="font-size: 25px;">2013</span> The PivotFitâ„¢ Dynamic Shoulder Harness combines a comfortable fit with a seriously engineered high-strength swivel buckle, for a central release thatâ€™s both elegant and secure.</p>
